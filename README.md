# BioListener

BioListener is an open-source project designed to revolutionize biosensing with portable, affordable, multi-channel
biosensing boards.

Powered by the ESP32 microcontroller, BioListener boards enable real-time data transfer via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BLE,
as well as on-board signal processing. These passive electrode-based boards are versatile tools for education, research,
and innovation. At an estimated cost of **just $30 per 8-channel board**, BioListener offers an unparalleled alternative
to costly devices like OpenBCI Cyton, which are often limited to one per group due to budget constraints.  
  
**With BioListener, everyone can have access to their own device, fostering hands-on learning and experimentation.** This
democratization of biosensing technology supports applications in neurorehabilitation, VR, gaming, assistive
technologies, and beyond.

The project has already completed the initial prototyping phase, delivering two functional PCB designs (each utilizing a
different ADC chip to ensure resilience against global chip shortages). Pre-evaluation results show significant promise.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

- **Affordable & Accessible**: $30 per 8 channel board, democratizing biosensing technology.
- **Easy to Use**: Passive electrode-based boards, easy setups, integration to popular BCI and biosignals processing frameworks.
- **Resilient Design**: Two distinct board designs utilizing AD7771 and ADS131M08 ADC chips.
- **High Connectivity, Real Time Data transfer**: Powered by ESP32 for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BLE communication. SD card support for offline data recording.
- **Customizability**: Modular add-ons for extended functionality. One of the boards (based on ADS131M08) includes built-in 6DOF IMU for motion tracking, and any other IMU can be easily added as an extension to any board.
- **Portable**: Compact size with 3D-printed enclosures. Total weight of the board with battery and 3D-printed enclosure is only **54g**.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for long battery life. 4 hours of continuous operation with a 700mAh battery at the highest sampling rate and data transfer via Wi-Fi at highest TX power. Up to 1400mAh battery can fit in the enclosure, and with use of Bluetooth or BLE (or offline data recording), the battery life can be extended to entire day.
- **Versatile**: Supports EEG, EMG, ECG, EOG, and other biosignal capture applications.
- **High Resolution**: 24-bit ADCs for precise signal capture.
- **High Sampling Rate**: Up to 8 channels at 2000Hz per channel at current firmware version. Basic speed: 500Hz per channel, 8 channels.
- **Usability**: Incorporates both hardware and software for a seamless user experience. Has a built-in battery charger, and can be charged and programmed via USB-C. Indication available as well.

### Supported Applications

BioListener is optimized for capturing biosignals in diverse scenarios, supporting use for both real-time data analysis
and recording:

- **EEG**: Electroencephalography for real-time brainwave capture.
- **EMG**: Electromyography for muscle activity detection.
- **ECG**: Electrocardiography for single- and multi-lead cardiac signal capture.
- **EOG**: Electrooculography for eye movement detection and analysis.

#### Demonstration
